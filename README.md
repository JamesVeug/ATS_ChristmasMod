## [ATS_API](https://github.com/JamesVeug/AgainstTheStormAPI/tree/master/ATS_API)

This mod is designed to be used in conjunction with other mods that wish to add new content to the game. It provides a number of useful functions for adding new things to the game in a way that takes away the struggles of understanding the code base and more.

Use this to save yourself HEAPS the pain of understanding the ATS codebase and why adding stuff doesn't work and giving up in the end. 

## [ExampleMod](https://github.com/JamesVeug/AgainstTheStormAPI/tree/master/ExampleMod)

Contains an example mod that uses the API to add new content to the game. 

If you are wanting to get started with modding the game then this mod can be copy+pasted then edited to include all the content you need. Docs still required.


## [ATS_API_Unity](https://github.com/JamesVeug/AgainstTheStormAPI/tree/master/ATS_API_Unity)

A Unity project used to create asset bundles for the API to include custom prefabs and models into the game. If you don't know what they are then you can ignore this.
